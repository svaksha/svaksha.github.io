# Namaste!

This is my github page that links to my [biography](http://svaksha.com/pages/Bio), [blog](http://svaksha.com/), the [automated github resume](http://resume.github.io/?svaksha) and lists a few repos on github and the mirrors below:
+ [IRA](http://svaksha.github.io/ira) :: My presentations, talks, slides and scientific programming snippets collection as Jupyter notebooks.
+ [Diversity-Index](https://github.com/svaksha/diversity-index) :: I curate a list of grants, scholarships and FA that encourages diversity in STEM fields aimed at half the world's population : Women!
+ [Julia.jl](http://svaksha.github.io/Julia.jl) :: I wanted to learn this new scientific programming language called Julia so I started curating a list of resources for it and decided to share it publicly.
+ [Pythonidae](http://svaksha.github.io/pythonidae) :: I also curate scientific programming resources for Python.
+ [yaksha](http://svaksha.github.io/yaksha) :: This is my collection of personal daemons for system updation and installation, bash shell scripts, dotfiles and configuration files that have been customized for my Linux box!
